This directory is for temporary patches of ptlib, opal and ekiga which
wait to be finished and be integrated upstream.

Each patch whose filename starts with ptlib_ will automatically be
used before building ptlib (but you need to trigger manually ptlib
building).  The same for opal and ekiga.

Look for "patch" string in ../Makefile to have more information.
