  /** Core object for the audio output support
   * The audio output core abstracts all functionality related to audio output
   * in a thread safe manner. Typically, most of the functions except start(),
   * stop(), set_buffer_size() and set_frame_data() will be called from a UI thread,
   * while the three mentioned funtions will be used by an audio streaming thread.
   * 
   * The audio output core abstracts different audio output managers, which can 
   * represent different backends like PTLIB, from the application and can 
   * switch the output device transparently for the audio streaming thread,
   * even while audio output is in progress.
   *
   * If the removal of an audio output device is detected by a failed
   * write or by a message from the HalCore, the audio output core will 
   * determine the responsible audio output manager and send a signal to the UI,
   * which can be used to update device lists. Also, if the removed device was the 
   * currently used one, the core falls back to the backup device.
   * 
   * A similar procedure is performed on the addition of a device. In case we fell 
   * back due to a removed device, and the respective device is re-added to the system,
   * it will be automatically activated.
