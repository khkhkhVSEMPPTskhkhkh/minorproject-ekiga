  /** Common VideoOutputManager implementation for DX and XV
   *
   * This class features the shared functionality between the DX and XV output managers.
   * The GMVideoOutputManager consists of a special thread that will do all accesses 
   * to the dxWindow and xWindow/xvWindow classes (important for windows where all
   * accesses to a specific window not only have to be thread-safe, but also have to
   * come all from the same thread). The main task of that thread is to wait for triggers
   * and then act on them, the thread itself will be active for the whole lifetime of Ekiga.
   * A call to open() from the core will signal the thread to execute the initalize function,
   * with open() blocking until the thread has finished its task. 
   * The thread is now ready to accept frames, which will arrive from the core via
   * set_frame_data(). set_frame_data will make a local copy of the image via memcpy,
   * and signal the thread that a new remote or local frame has arrived and is ready to be
   * displayed. Then set_frame_data() will be left, while the actual display of the frame
   * will be performed in the thread.
   * Once the thread has been triggered with a new frame to display, it will first call redraw
   * for passing the frame to the graphics adaptor, and then do_sync to actually displaying it.
   * The reason these procedures are separate has the following motivation: do_sync can block for
   * quite some time if synv-to-vblank is active. If this would be executed in the mutex-protected
   * redraw procedure, we would be blocking the video processing threads, possibly leading to lost packets
   * and interfering with synchronous frame transmission.
   * redraw() will check whether the dxWindow/xvWindow classes need to be reinitialized (e.g. we want to 
   * switching from non-pip mode to pip mode, etc.), do that if desired and then pass pointers to the 
   * (copied) frames to the dxWindow/xvWindow classes via display_frame() and display_pip_frames(). It will
   * also determine if only one or both frames need to be synched to the screen.
   * Once the device has been opened/initialized and no new frame arrives, the frames will nevertheless
   * be updated every 250 ms.
   * In order to close the devices, an uninit request is sent to the thread, which performes the 
   * necessary cleanup. Like open(), close() blocks until the thread signals the cleanup has been completed.

   * the frames to all of them.
   * Before passing the first frame, start() has to be called. In order to close the video,
   * stop() has to be called. The video output core interacts with the GUI when switching to fullscreen,
   * when the size of the video has been changed and when a device is opened and closed.
