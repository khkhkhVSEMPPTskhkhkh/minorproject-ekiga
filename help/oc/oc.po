"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a protocol developed by the IETF "

"H.323 was originally created to provide a mechanism for transporting "
"multimedia applications over LANs but it has rapidly evolved to address the "
"growing needs of VoIP networks. One strength of H.323 was the relatively "
"early availability of a set of standards, not only defining the basic call "
"model, but in addition the supplementary services, needed to address "
"business communication expectations. H.323 was the first VoIP standard to "
"adopt the IETF standard RTP to transport audio and video over IP networks. "
"H.323 is based on the ISDN Q.931 protocol and is suited for interworking "
"scenarios between IP and ISDN, respectively between IP and QSIG. A call "
"model, similar to the ISDN call model, eases the introduction of IP "
"Telephony into existing networks of ISDN based PBX systems."
