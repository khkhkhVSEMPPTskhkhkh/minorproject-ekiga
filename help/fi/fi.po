"H.323 was originally created to provide a mechanism for transporting "

"business communication expectations. H.323 was the first VoIP standard to "
"adopt the IETF standard RTP to transport audio and video over IP networks. "
"H.323 is based on the ISDN Q.931 protocol and is suited for interworking "
"scenarios between IP and ISDN, respectively between IP and QSIG. A call "
